    "## About the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a long history of developing advanced imaging spectrometers for new science and applications, and the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) builds on this foundation. EMIT launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on July 14, 2022. The data shows high-confidence research grade methane plumes from point source emitters - updated as they are identified - in keeping with Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Open Science and Open Data policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Methane is a strong greenhouse gas that is invisible to the human eye. Large methane emissions, typically referred to as point source emissions, represent a significant proportion of total methane emissions from the production, transport, and processing of oil and natural gas, landfills, and other sources. By measuring the spectral fingerprint of methane, EMIT can map areas of high methane concentration over background levels in the atmosphere, identifying plume complexes, and estimating the methane enhancements."
